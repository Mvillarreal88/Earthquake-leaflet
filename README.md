# leaflet-challenge


### Data set Analysis:

We start by loading in the Data from the https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php site. We choose one of the many links on the side that goes over the earthquake data, in this case we used the data for the last 30 days.

### Visualizing the data:

• We create a map using Leaflet that will plot all the Earthquakes based on the latitude and longitude of the JSON data.

• Our markers will vary depending on the size and depth of the Earthquake, and will also vary in color. 

• When a user clicks on one of the Earthquakes it will also provide data for that specific event, including Time and specific Location.
